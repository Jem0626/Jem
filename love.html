Even if we’re miles apart, my heart feels like you’re right here beside me. Every day, I carry your smile, your laugh, and your love with me, like a little piece of home I can hold onto. Distance may keep us from holding hands, but it can’t stop me from loving you more each day. One day soon, the space between us will disappear, and I’ll finally get to tell you in person how much you mean to me. Until then, remember you’re my first thought in the morning, my last thought at night, and my favorite dream in between.

      "You make every moment feel like magic. With you by my side, I feel unstoppable. My heart beats only for you, and nothing else matters. Your laughter is like music to my soul, and I never want it to stop. Through all the seasons of life, I want to be with you, facing everything together. I will always be there to hold your hand, to support you, and to love you. You're the reason I wake up with a smile every day. I'm grateful for every second spent with you, and I cherish every moment. Together, we are unstoppable. My love for you only grows stronger with each passing day."
